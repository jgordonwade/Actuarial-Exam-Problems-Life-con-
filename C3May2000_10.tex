 Taxicabs leave a hotel with a group of passengers at a Poisson rate 
$\lambda =10$ per hour. The number
of people in each group taking a cab is independent and has the following 
probabilities:

\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{cc}
Number of People & Probability \\ \hline
1 & 0.60 \\
2 & 0.30 \\
3 & 0.10
\end{tabular}\end{center}

Using the normal approximation, calculate the probability that at least 
1050 people leave the hotel in a cab during a 72-hour period.
