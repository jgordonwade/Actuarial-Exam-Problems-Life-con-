For a special fully discrete 20-year endowment insurance on (40), you are given:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The only death benefit is the return of annual net premiums accumulated with
    interest at 5\% to the end of the year of death.
  \item The endowment benefit is 100,000.
  \item Mortality follows the Standard Ultimate Life Table.
  \item $i=0.05$. 
\end{enumerate}
Calculate the annual net premium.

\showsol{\bsoln
  Let $\pi$ denote the annual net premium.

  \bigskip
  Condition on whether (40) survives the 20 year endowment period or not.

  \[
  0 = \Expect{L} = \Expect{L|K_x<20}\Prob{K_x<20} + \Expect{L|K_x\geq 20}\Prob{K_x\geq 20} 
   \]

   \medskip
   $\Expect{L|K_x<20}$ In this case there is no endowment payment, and
   the premiums are returned with interest, with the interest rate being the same as what we used to discount the present value.
   So $\Expect{L|K_x<20} = 0$.

   \medskip
   $\Expect{L|K_x\geq 20}$ In this case there is no premium refund, only the 20-year endowment. Since the endowment is paid 20 years from now, it's present value is
   $v^{20}\cdot 10^5$, and since the premiums are paid for a period of 20 years certain, the EPV of the premium payments is $\pi\ddot{a}_{\halfbox{20}}$.
   So $\Expect{L|K_x\geq 20} = v^{20}\cdot 10^5-\pi\ddot{a}_{\halfbox{20}}$. So the Equivalence Principle gives 
   \[
        0 = \Bigl(v^{20}\cdot 10^5-\pi\ddot{a}_{\halfbox{20}}\Bigr)\prepostsub{20}{p}{x} \\
    \]
    or     $\pi  =  \dfrac{v^{20}\cdot 10^5}{\ddot{a}_{\halfbox{20}}},$ or $\boxed{\pi=2880.25}$
