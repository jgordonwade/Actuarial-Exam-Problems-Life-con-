 Job offers for a college graduate arrive according to a Poisson process with mean 2 per
month. A job offer is acceptable if the wages are at least 28,000. Wages offered are
mutually independent and follow a lognormal distribution with $\mu=10.12$ and $\sigma=0.12$. 
Calculate the probability that it will take a college graduate more than 3 months to
receive an acceptable job offer.
