The repair costs for boats in a marina have the following characteristics:
\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline 
              & Number   & Probability that & Mean of repair cost & Variance of repair cost \\
Boat type     & of boats & repair is needed & given a repair      & given a repair \\ \hline
Power boats   & 100      & 0.3              & 300                 & 10,000 \\ 
Sailboats     & 300      & 0.1              & 1000                & 400,000 \\
Luxury Yachts & 50       & 0.6              & 4000                & 2,000,000 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}\end{center}
At most one repair is required per boat each year.

The marina budgets an amount, Y, equal to the aggregate mean repair costs plus the standard
deviation of the aggregate repair costs.

Calculate Y.
