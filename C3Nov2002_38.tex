A large machine in the ABC Paper Mill is 25 years old when ABC purchases a 5-year term
insurance paying a benefit in the event the machine breaks down.
Given:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Annual benefit premiums of 6643 are payable at the beginning of the year.
\item A benefit of 500,000 is payable at the moment of breakdown.
\item Once a benefit is paid, the insurance contract is terminated.
\item Machine breakdowns follow De Moivre's law with $l_x = 100 - x .$
\item $i = 0.06$
\end{enumerate}
Calculate the benefit reserve for this insurance at the end of the third year.
