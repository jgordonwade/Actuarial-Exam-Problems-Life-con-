Scientists are searching for a vaccine for a disease. You are given:
\begin{itemize}
  \item 100,000 lives age x are exposed to the disease.
  \item Future lifetimes are independent, except that the vaccine, if available, will be given to all at the end of year 1.
  \item The probability that the vaccine will be available is 0.2.
  \item For each life during year 1, $\qx{x}=0.02$.
  \item For each life during year 2, $\qx{x+1}=0.01$ if the vaccine has been given, and $\qx{x+1}=0.02$ if it has not been given.
\end{itemize}
Calculate the standard deviation of the number of survivors at the end of year 2.

  We're going to use (A.7) of Appendix A.4 in the text, which is 
  \[ \Var{N} = \Expect{\Var{N|P}} + \Var{\Expect{N|P}} \]
  for random variable $N$ and $P$ which we will define, where $P$ is the probability that (x) survives 

  \smallskip
   \begin{description}
   \bull If the vaccine \underline{is not} available:
    
     then for an individual (x), 
    \(       \qx{x} = \qx{x+1} = 0.02, \) so that \(  \px{x} = \px{x+1} = 0.98, \) so that
    \[    \px[2]{x} = \px{x}\px{x+1} = 0.98^2 = 0.9604 \]

  \bull If the vaccine \underline{is } available, then similarly
     \[     \px[2]{x} = 0.98\cdot 0.99 = 0.9702. \]
  \end{description}

So for a given individual, the
    probability of that individual's surviving two years is itself a random variable (depending on whether the vaccine is developed or not), call it ${P}$:
   \bears 
          P &\eqdef& \Prob{ \text{ (x) survives two years }} 
           = \left\{ \begin{array}{rl} 0.9604 & \text{w/ prob. }0.8 \\ 0.9702 & \text{w/ prob. }0.2 \end{array}\right.  \\
          \Expect{P} &=& 0.2\cdot 0.9702 + 0.8\cdot 0.9604 = 0.96236  \\
          \Expect{P^2} &=& 0.2\cdot 0.9702^2 + 0.8\cdot 0.9604^2 = 0.926152136 \\
          \Var{P} &=&     \Expect{P^2} -       \Expect{P}^2  = 0.926152136  - 0.96236^2 = 0.0000153664.
    \eears
 
    Now let $N$ be the number of people of the original 100,000 that survive two years, so that 
    \[   N|{P} \sim \text{Binomial}(100000,{P}), \]
    so that
    \bears
        \Expect{N|{P}} &=& 100000\,{P}, \\
        \Var{N|{P}} &=& 100000\,{P}(1-{P}).
    \eears
    Now \bears
        \Var{\Expect{N|{P}}} &=& \Var{100000\,{P}} = 100000^2\Var{P} = 100000^2\cdot 0.0000153664 = 153664 \\
        \Expect{\Var{N|P}} &=& \Expect{100000\,{P}(1-{P})} = 100000\cdot(0.96236  - 0.926152136 ) = 3620.79
    \eears
     so that \(  \Var{N} = 153664  + 3620.79 = 157284.79, \) so \[ \boxed{\Std{N} = 396.59.} \]
