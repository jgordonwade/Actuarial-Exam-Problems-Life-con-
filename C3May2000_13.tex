 An investment fund is established to provide benefits on 400 independent 
lives age x.
\begin{description}
\item[(i)] On January 1, 2001, each life is issued a 10-year deferred whole life insurance of 1000, payable at the moment of death.
\item[(ii)] Each life is subject to a constant force of mortality of 0.05.
\item[(iii)] The force of interest is 0.07.
\end{description}
Calculate the amount needed in the investment fund on January 1, 2001, so that the probability,
as determined by the normal approximation, is 0.95 that the fund will be sufficient to provide
these benefits.

For one such policy the mean $1000\times \prepostsub{10|}{\bar{A}}{x}$ is $1000\times \mu e^{-10(\mu+\delta)}/(\mu + \delta)$
so the mean for the portfolio, call it $\mu$, is 
\[
   \mu = 400\times 1000\times \prepostsub{10|}{\bar{A}}{x} = 50,199.035.
\]
The variance for one policy is $1000^2\times (\prepostsub{10|\!\!\!\!}{\pretwo{\bar{A}}}{x} - \prepostsub{10|}{\bar{A}}{x}^2)$ so 
\bears
   \sigma &=& \sqrt{400\times 1000^2\times (\prepostsub{10|\!\!\!\!}{\pretwo{\bar{A}}}{x} - \prepostsub{10|}{\bar{A}}{x}^2)} \\
   \sigma &=& 20,000\times \sqrt{\prepostsub{10|\!\!\!\!}{\pretwo{\bar{A}}}{x} - \prepostsub{10|}{\bar{A}}{x}^2} \\
   &=& 3073.143

Now, approximating the distribution of the payout as a normal random variable, we have:
\bears
   \Prob{X\leq\xi} &=& 0.95 \\
   \Prob{\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}\leq \frac{\xi-\mu}{\sigma}} &=& 0.95 \\
   \Prob{Z \leq \frac{\xi-\mu}{\sigma}} &=& 0.95 \\
   \frac{\xi-\mu}{\sigma} &=& 1.6449 \\
   \xi &=& \mu + 1.6449\times \sigma = 55254.05.
