\JGWitem{C3 Nov 2005, \#31}   % \S2 Single Life Survival
The graph of a piecewise linear survival function, $S_0(x)$, consists of 3 line segments with
endpoints $(0, 1),$ $(25, 0.50)$, $(75, 0.40),$ and $ (100, 0).$

Calculate $\dfrac{\qx[20|55]{15}}{\qx[55]{35}}$

\showsol{\bsoln
\[
  \dfrac{\qx[20|55]{15}}{\qx[55]{35}} = \dfrac{\px[20]{15}\cdot \qx[55]{35}}{\qx[55]{35}} = \px[20]{15}
     = \dfrac{S_0(35)}{S_0(15)}
\]
Since 35 is $1/5$ of the way from 25 to 75, $S_0(35)$ is $1/5$ of the way from 0.50 to 0.40 which is 0.48, so $S_0(35)=0.48.$ 

Since 15 is $3/5$ of the way from 0 to 25, $S_0(15)$ is $3/5$ of the way from 1.00 to 0.50 which is 0.70, so $S_0(15)=0.70.$

So $\boxed{\dfrac{\qx[20|55]{15}}{\qx[55]{35}} = \dfrac{0.48}{0.70} = 0.68571}$.
