 Kings of Fredonia drink glasses of wine at a Poisson rate of 2 glasses per day.

\medskip
Assassins attempt to poison the king's wine glasses. There is a 0.01 probability that any
given glass is poisoned. Drinking poisoned wine is always fatal instantly and is the only
cause of death.

\medskip
The occurrences of poison in the glasses and the number of glasses drunk are independent
events.
\medskip

Calculate the probability that the current king survives at least 30 days.

The poisoned glasses occur at a Poisson rate of $\lambda=2\times 0.01=1/50$ glasses per day.

\medskip
Denote by $T$ the wait-time until the first poisoned glass. 

We know that $T\sim\mbox{Exponential}(\lambda)$. We want $\Prob{T>30}$ days. 
\bears
 \Prob{T>30} &=& 1-\Prob{T\leq 30} = 1-F(30) = 1-\left[1-e^{-30\lambda}\right] = e^{-0.6} \approx 0.549
