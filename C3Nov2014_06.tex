     0 &=& 30,000\cdot \prepostsub{20}{E}{40}\ddot{a}_{60} + \pi\termifyn{A_{40:\halfbox{20}}} - \pi  \\ \\
     \pi &=& \dfrac{30,000\cdot \prepostsub{20}{E}{40}\ddot{a}_{60}}{1-\termifyn{A_{40:\halfbox{20}}}}  
     = \dfrac{30,000\cdot 0.36663\cdot 14.9041}{1-(0.38126-0.36663)} = \boxed{166362.59}
