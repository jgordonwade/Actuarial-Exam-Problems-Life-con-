\JGWitem{May 2000 \#6}
 A special purpose insurance company is set up to insure one single life. 
The risk consists of a single possible claim.
\begin{enumerate}
\item  The claim amount distribution is:
\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline 
 Amount & Probability \\ \hline
   100  & 0.60 \\ 
   200  & 0.40 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}\end{center}
\item The probability that the claim does not occur by time $t$ 
     is $1/(1+t)$. 
\item The insurer's surplus at time $t$ is 
  $U(t) = 60 + 20t - S(t)$, where $S(t)$ is the aggregate claim
  amount paid by time $t$.
\item The claim is payable immediately.
\end{enumerate}

Calculate the probability of ruin.
\begin{description}
\item (A) $4/7$
\item (B) $3/5$
\item (C) $2/3$
\item (D) $3/4$
\item (E) $7/8$
\end{description}

 Denote by $T$ the time-of-claim. From the problem statement we have 
\[  
  \Prob{T<t} = 1-{1\over 1+t} = {t\over 1+t}.
\] 
Clearly $\Prob{T<\infty}=1$, that is, there is eventually a claim.

Ruin occurs if for any $t>0$ we have $U(t)\leq 0$. If this happens, 
it happens at time $T$. So we need to compute $\Prob{U(t)\leq 0}$. 
Now, 
\bears
  \Prob{U(T)<\leq 0} &=& \Prob{60+20T +S(T)\leq 0} = 
    \Prob{T\leq {S(T)-60\over 20}} \\
  &=& \Prob{\Bigl[T\leq {S(T)-60\over 20}\Bigr]|\mbox{ small claim}}
      \Prob{\mbox{small claim}} \\
  && +  \Prob{\Bigl[T\leq {S(T)-60\over 20}\Bigr]|\mbox{ large claim}}
      \Prob{\mbox{large claim}} \\
  &=& 0.6\Prob{T\leq 2} + 0.4\Prob{T\leq 7} = 0.75.
