\JGWitem{C3 May 2013, \#22}
For a whole life insurance of 10,000 on (x), you are given:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] Death benefits are payable at the end of the year of death.
\item[(ii)] A premium of 30 is payable at the start of each month.
\item[(iii)] Commissions are 5\% of each premium.
\item[(iv)] Expenses of 100 are payable at the start of each year.
\item[(v)] $i = 0.05$
\item[(vi)] $1000\Ax{x+10}=400$
\item[(vii)] $\tV{10}$ is the gross premium reserve at the end of year 10 for this insurance.
\end{itemize}
Calculate $\tV{10}$ using the two-term Woolhouse formula for annuities.

  At $t=10$ years, given that $x$ has survived:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item the EPV of future benefits is $10,000 \Ax{x+10}$ which is $4000,$
  \item the EPV of future expenses is $100\ax**{x+10} + 12\cdot(0.05\cdot 30\cdot \ax**{x+10}[(12)]) = 100\ax**{x+10} + 18\ax**{x+10}[(12)],$
  \item and the EPV of future premiums is $12\cdot 30 \cdot \ax**{x+10}[(12)] = 360\ax**{x+10}[(12)]$
 \end{itemize}
 so
 \bears  \tV{10} &=& 4000 + 100\ax**{x+10} +18 \ax**{x+10}[(12)] - 360\ax**{x+10}[(12)] \\
   \tV{10} &=& 4000 + 100\ax**{x+10} -342 \ax**{x+10}[(12)] \\
   \tV{10} &=& 4000 + 100\dfrac{1-\Ax{x+10}}{d} - 342\left(\dfrac{1-\Ax{x+10}}{d} - 11/24\right)  \\
   \tV{10} &=& 4000 + 100\dfrac{1-0.4}{0.05/1.05} - 342\left(\dfrac{1-0.4}{0.5/1.05} - 11/24\right)  = \boxed{1107.55}
