For a special fully discrete whole life insurance, you are given:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The death benefit is $1000(1.03)^k$ for death in policy year k , for $k =1, 2, 3,\ldots$.
\item  $q_x  = 0.05$
\item  $i = 0.06$
\item   $\ddot{a}_{x+1}  = 7.00$
\item  The annual net premium for this insurance at issue age  $x$ is 110.
\end{enumerate}
Calculate the annual net premium for this insurance at issue age $x + 1$.
\showsol{\bsoln
  Denote the annual net premium for this insurance at issue ages $x$ and $x+1$ by ``$P_{x}$'' and ``$P_{x+1}$'', respectively, and the APV of the geometrically increasing death benefit by
  $1000(GA)_x$. 
  Then
  \[
      (GA)_x = \Expect{(1.03\,v)^{K_x+1}} = \Expect{v_*^{K_x+1}} = A^*_x,
  \]
  where $A^*$ is APV of a unit whole-life insurance, computed with $v(=1/1.06)$ replaced by \underline{$v_*=1.03/1.06$}.

  \bigskip

  This says that the APV $A_x^*$ of the geometrically increasing death benefit is mathematically the same as the APV $A_x$ of a fixed-amount death benefit, but with a different interest rate.

  Now:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Use recursion to get $\ddot{a}_{x}$ from $\ddot{a}_{x+1}$ (given).
       \bears
             && \ddot{a}_x = 1+vp_x\ddot{a}_{x+1}  = 1+\frac{1-0.05}{1+0.06}\cdot 7  \\
             && \ddot{a}_x = 7.273585
       \eears

      \item Use $\ddot{a}_x$ and $P_x$ (given) in the Equivalence Principle to get $A^*_x$.
        \bears
            \Expect{\rm{Loss}} = 0 &=& 1000\cdot A^*_x - P_x\ddot{a}_x = 1000\cdot A^*_x - 110\cdot 7.273585 \\
                                                     && A^*_x = 0.80009
        \eears

      \item Use recursion to get $A^*_{x+1}$ from $A^*_x$. 
       \bears
             && A^*_x = v_*q_x + v_*p_xA^*_{x+1} \\
             && A^*_{x+1} = 0.814103 
       \eears

       \item Use $A^*_{x+1}$ and $\ddot{a}_{x+1}$ (given) in the Equivalence Principle to get $P_{x+1}$
       \bears
            \Expect{\rm{Loss}} = 0 &=& 1000\cdot A^*_{x+1} - P_{x+1}\ddot{a}_{x+1} \\
                                                     && \boxed{P_{x+1} = 116.30046}
        \eears
  \end{enumerate}
