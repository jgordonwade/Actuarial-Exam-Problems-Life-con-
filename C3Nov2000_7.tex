For a multiple decrement table, you are given:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Decrement (1) is death, decrement (2) is disability, and decrement (3) is
withdrawal.
\item $q_{60}^{'(1)} = 0.010$
\item $q_{60}^{'(2)} = 0.050$
\item $q_{60}^{'(3)} = 0.100$
\item Withdrawals occur only at the end of the year.
\item Mortality and disability are uniformly distributed over each year of age in the
associated single decrement tables.
\end{enumerate}
Calculate $q_{60}^{3}$
