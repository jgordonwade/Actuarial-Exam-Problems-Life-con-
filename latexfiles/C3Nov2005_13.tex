\JGWitem{C3 Nov 2005, \#13}   % \S2 Single Life Survival
The actuarial department for the SharpPoint Corporation models the lifetime of pencil
sharpeners from purchase using a generalized DeMoivre model with 
\( S_0(x) = (1-x/\omega)^{\alpha},\) for $\alpha>0$ and $0<x<\omega$. 

\smallskip
A senior actuary examining mortality tables for pencil sharpeners has determined that the
original value of $\alpha$ must change. You are given:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The new complete expectation of life at purchase is half what it was previously.
  \item The new force of mortality for pencil sharpeners is 2.25 times the previous force of mortality for all durations.
  \item $\omega$ remains the same.
\end{enumerate}
Calculate the original value of $\alpha$.
