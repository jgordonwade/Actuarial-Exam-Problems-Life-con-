Two types of insurance claims are made to an insurance company. For each type. the number of clainis follows a Poisson distribution and the amount of each claim is uniformly distributed as follows: 
\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\hline
Type of Claim & Poisson Paramter $\lambda$ for \# claims & Range of each Claim Amt \\ \hline
I & 12 & (0,1) \\ 
II & 4 & (0,5) \\ \hline
\end{tabular}\end{center}


The numbers of claims of the two types are independent and the claim amounts and claim numbers are independent. 
Calculate the normal approximation to the probability that the total of claim amounts exceeds 18.
