For a special 3-year term life insurance policy on (x) and (y) with dependent future
lifetimes, you are given:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A death benefit of 100,000 is paid at the end of the year of death if both (x) and (y) die within the same year. No death benefits are payable otherwise.
\item $p_{x+k} = 0.84366$ for $k=0,1,2$.
\item $p_{y+k} = 0.86936$ for $k=0,1,2$.
\item $p_{x+k:y+k} = 0.77105$ for $k=0,1,2$.
\item \

Maturity (in years) & Annual Effective Spot Rate \\ \hline

\end{enumerate}
Calculate the expected present value of the death benefit.

   In order for both (x) and (y) to fail in the same year, say year $k$, both (x) and (y) must survive $k-1$ complete years {\it and then} the lives aged (x+k-1) and (y+k-1) must both fail
   within one year. Let's analyze this sequence of events:
  \begin{description}
    \bull The probability that  both (x) and (y) must survive $k-1$ complete years is the probability that the joint-life status (xy) survives $k-1$ years, which is
       $\prepostsub{(k-1)}{p}{xy}$. In terms of the given information, 
      \[    \prepostsub{(k-1)}{p}{xy} = (0.77105)^{k-1} . \]
    \bull The probability that the lives aged (x+k-1) and (y+k-1) both fail within one year is the probability that the last-survivor status
       ($\overline{\rm x+k-1:y+k-1}$) fails within one years, which is $q_{\overline{x+k-1:y+k-1}}$.
       And, in terms of the given information, 
      \bears
          q_{\overline{x+k-1:y+k-1}} &=& q_{x+k-1} + q_{y+k-1} - q_{x+k-1:y+k-1} \\ &=& 1-\Bigl(\,p_{x+k-1} + p_{y+k-1} - p_{x+k-1:y+k-1}\,\Bigr) \\ &=& 1-(0.84366+ 0.86936-0.77105) \\ &=& 0.05803.
      \eears
  \end{description}
  So the probability that they both fail in year $k$ is
   \[
         \Prob{\text{both fail in year $k$}} = (0.77105)^{k-1}\cdot  0.05803.
  \]
  So, the EPV of the death benefit is
  \bears
       100,000\cdot\left(\dfrac{0.05803}{1.03} + \dfrac{0.77105\cdot 0.05803}{1.08^2} + \dfrac{0.77105^2\cdot 0.05803}{1.1^3} \right) = \boxed{12062.09}
