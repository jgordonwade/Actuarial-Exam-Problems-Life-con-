\JGWitem{C3 Nov 2012 \#12} 
A party of scientists arrives at a remote island. Unknown to them, a hungry tyrannosaur lives on the island. You model the future lifetimes of the scientists
as a three-state model, where: 
\begin{description}
 \item State 0: no scientists have been eaten.
 \item State 1: exactly one scientist has been eaten.
 \item State 2: at least two scientists have been eaten.
\end{description}
You are given:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] Until a scientist is eaten, they suspect nothing, so
   \[ \mu_t^{01} = 0.01 + 0.02\cdot 2^t, \; t>0. \]
\item[(ii)] Until a scientist is eaten, they suspect nothing, so the tyrannosaur may come across two together and eat both, with
   \[ \mu_t^{02} = 0.5\mu_t^{01}, \; t>0. \]
 \item[(iii)] After the first death, scientists become much more careful, so
   \[ \mu_t^{12} = 0.01\mu_t^{01}, \; t>0. \]
\end{itemize}
Calculate the probability that no scientists are eaten in the first year.
\showsol{\bsoln
  The probability that no scientist has been eaten by time $1$ is the probability that the system remains in state 0 up to time $1$, which is $\px{1}[00]$
which is given by 
\bears
   \px{1}[00] &=& \exp\left(-\int_0^1 \mu_t^{01} + \mu_t^{02}\,dt \right) = 0.943385
