\JGWitem{ MLC Nov 2016, \# 1}
For the country of Bienna, you are given:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Bienna publishes mortality rates in biennial form, that is, mortality rates are of the form: \( \qx[2]{2x}\) for $x=0,1,2,\ldots$. 
\item Deaths are assumed to be uniformly distributed between ages $2x$ and $2x+2$ , for $x=0,1,2,\ldots$. 
\item $\qx[2]{50} = 0.02$
\item $\qx[2]{52} = 0.04$
\end{enumerate}
Calculate the probability that (50) dies during the next 2.5 years.

      &=& 0.02 + 0.98\cdot 0.25\cdot 0.04 = \underline{0.0298}
