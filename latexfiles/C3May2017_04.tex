You are given the following Markov model
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] Annual transition probabilities are as follows:
\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{c|ccc} & Healthy & Sick & Terminated \\ \hline
   Healthy & 0.90 & 0.05 & 0.05 \\ Sick & 0.30 & 0.60 & 0.10 \\ Terminated & 0.00 & 0.00 & 1.00 \end{tabular}\end{center}
\item[(ii)] The annual health care costs each year, paid at the middle of the year, for each state, are:
\[ \text{Healthy: }500 \qquad\text{Sick: } 5000 \qquad\text{Terminated:} 0 \]
\item[(iii)] Transitions occur at the end of the year.
\item[(iv)] $\delta=0.04$
\end{itemize}
Calculate the actuarial present value of health care costs over the next three years for an individual who is currently Healthy.

\showsol{\bsoln
  An individual who is currently Healthy will still be classified as Healthy at mid-year, so the
  EPV of the first year's medical costs is \underline{$500\cdot e^{-0.02}=\underline{490.09934}$} ($v^{1/2}$ since the med. costs are paid at midyear).

   \bigskip
  At midway thru the 2nd year, an individual who is currently Healthy will then classified as 
   \begin{description}
      \item (H$\rightarrow$H) Healthy with probability $0.9,$ and
      \item (H$\rightarrow$S) Sick with probability $0.05,$
   \end{description}
  so the EPV of the second year's medical costs is \underline{\dsy{e^{-0.06}  \left(0.9\cdot 500 + 0.05\cdot 5000\right)}=659.235}
 
 \bigskip
  At midway thru the 3nd year, an individual who is currently Healthy will then classified as 
   \begin{description}
      \item (H$\rightarrow$H$\rightarrow$H) + (H$\rightarrow$S$\rightarrow$H) Healthy with probability $0.9^2 + 0.05\cdot 0.30 = 0.825,$ and
      \item (H$\rightarrow$H$\rightarrow$S) + (H$\rightarrow$S$\rightarrow$S) Sick with probability $0.9\cdot 0.05 + 0.05\cdot 0.60= 0.075, $
   \end{description}
   so the EPV of the second year's medical costs is \underline{\dsy{e^{-0.1}  \left(0.825\cdot 500 + 0.075\cdot 5000\right)}= 712.559,}

 \bigskip
   So the EPV of medical costs in the first 3 years is:
   \[ 490.09934 + 659.235 + 712.559 = \boxed{1861.89} \]
