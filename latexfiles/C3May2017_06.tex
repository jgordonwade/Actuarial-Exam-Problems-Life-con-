For an annual life annuity-due of 1 with a 5-year certain period on (55), you are given:
\begin{enumerate}
\item   Mortality follows the Illustrative Life Table
\item    $i = 0.06$
\end{enumerate}
Calculate the probability that the sum of the undiscounted payments actually made under this 
annuity will exceed the expected present value, at issue, of the annuity.
\showsol{\bsoln
  Let ``$a$'' denote the EPV of this annuity,
  \bears 
       a &=& a_{\halfbox{5}} + \prepostsub{5}{E}{55} \ddot{a}_{60} = \dfrac{1-1.06^{-5}}{0.06/1.06} + 0.70810\cdot 11.1454 = 12.35716
  \eears
  So in order for the (undiscounted) sum of the payments to exeeed this value, there must be 13 payment, which means that (55) has survive
  at least 12 years, and the probability of this is
  \[
       \prepostsub{12}{p}{55} = \dfrac{7,201,634}{8,640,860} = \boxed{0.83344}
  \]
