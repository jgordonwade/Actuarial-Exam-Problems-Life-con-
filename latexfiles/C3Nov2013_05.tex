Russell, age 40, wins the SOA lottery. He will receive both:
\begin{description}
\bull A deferred life annuity of K per year, payable continuously, starting at age $40+\ecirc_{40}$, and
\bull An annuity certain of K per year, payable continuously, for $\ecirc_{40}$ years.
\end{description}
You are given:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\mu=0.02$
\item $\delta = 0.01$
\item The actuarial present value of the payments is 10,000.
\end{enumerate}
Calculate $K.$

Since the forces of mortality and interest are constant, we have
\bears
   \ecirc_{40} &=& = 1/\mu = 50, \\
   \ax*{\angl{50}} &=& \dfrac{1-e^{0.01\cdot  50}}{0.01} = 39.3469, \\
   \ax*{90} &=& \dfrac{1}{\mu + \delta} = 33.33333 \\
   \Ex[50]{40} &=& e^{-(\mu + \delta)\cdot 50} = 0.223130, \\
   10,000 &=& K\cdot ( 39.3469 +  0.223130\cdot 33.33333 ) \qquad \boxed{K = 213.75}
