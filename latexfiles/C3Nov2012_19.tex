\JGWitem{Nov 2012 \#19}
For whole life annuities-due of 15 per month on each of 200 lives age 62 with independent
future lifetimes, you are given:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $i=0.06$
\item $A_{62}^{(12)} = 0.4075$ and $\pretwo{A^{(12)}_62} = 0.2105$
\item $\pi$ is the single premium to be paid by each of the 200 lives.
\item $S$ is the present value random variable at time 0 of total payments made to the 200 lives.
\end{enumerate}
Using the normal approximation, calculate $\pi$ such that $\Prob{200\pi>S}=0.90$
