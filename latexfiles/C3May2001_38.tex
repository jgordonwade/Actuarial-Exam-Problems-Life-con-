Lottery Life issues a special fully discrete whole life insurance on (25):
\begin{enumerate}
\item At the end of the year of death there is a random drawing. With probability 0.2,
the death benefit is 1000. With probability 0.8, the death benefit is 0.
\item At the start of each year, including the first, while (25) is alive, there is a random
drawing. With probability 0.8, the level premium $\pi$ is paid. With probability
0.2, no premium is paid.
\item  The random drawings are independent.
\item Mortality follows the Illustrative Life Table.
\item $i = 0.06$
\item $\pi$ is determined using the equivalence principle.
\end{enumerate}
