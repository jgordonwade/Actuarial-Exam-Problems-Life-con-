A whole life policy provides that upon accidental death as a passenger on an airplane a benefit of 
1,000,000 will be paid. If death occurs from other accidental causes, a death benefit of 500,000 
will be paid. If death occurs from a cause other than an accident, a death benefit of 250,000 will 
be paid.

You are given:
\begin{enumerate}
\item   Death benefits are payable at the moment of death.
\item  $ \mu^{(1)} = 1/2,000,000$  where (1) indicates accidental death as a passenger on an airplane.
\item  $\mu^{(2)} = 1/250,000$ where (2) indicates death from other accidental causes.
\item   $\mu^{(3)} = 1/10,000$ where (3) indicates non-accidental death.
\item   $\delta = 0.06$
\end{enumerate}
Calculate the single benefit premium for this insurance.

Survival function \dsy{\prepostsubsup{t}{p}{x}{(\tau)} = e^{-\int_0^t \mu_x^{(\tau)}(s)\,ds}}.

Density function $f_{T_x}$ breaks up as follows:
\bears
    f_{T_x}(t) &=& \mu_x^{(\tau)}\prepostsubsup{t}{p}{x}{(\tau)} \\
                    &=& \Bigl(\mu^{(1)}_x(t)+\mu^{(1)}_x(t)+ \mu^{(1)}_x(t)\Bigr) \prepostsubsup{t}{p}{x}{(\tau)}  \\
                    &=& f_{T_x}^{(1)}(t) + f_{T_x}^{(2)}(t) + f_{T_x}^{(3)}(t) 
\eears
Since the $\mu$'s are constant, the $f_{T_x}^{(j)}$'s take the following simple form:
\[   f_{T_x}^{(j)}(t) = \mu^{(j)}e^{-\mu^{(\tau)}t}. \]
     
The single benefit premium is the APV of the benefit, which is:
\bears
    \rm{APV \ Ben.} &=& \sum_{j=1}^3 \int_0^\infty e^{-\delta t} B_j f_{T_x}^{(j)}(t)  \\ 
                         &=& \sum_{j=1}^3 \int_0^\infty B_j \mu^{(j)} e^{-(\delta +\mu^{(\tau)})t}  \\
                         &=& \sum_{j=1}^3 \int_0^\infty \dfrac{B_j \mu^{(j)}}{\delta +\mu^{(\tau)}}  
                         = \dfrac{\frac{1,000,000}{2,000,000} + \frac{500,000}{250,000} + \frac{250,000}{10,000}}{\frac{6}{100} + \frac{209}{2,000,000}} 
                         = \boxed{457.536}
