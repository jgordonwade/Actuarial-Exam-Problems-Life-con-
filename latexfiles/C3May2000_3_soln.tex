 For a fully discrete two-year term insurance of 400 on (x):
\begin{enumerate}
\item  $i = 0.1$.
\medskip
\item  $400\termify{P_{x:\halfbox{2}}} = 74.33$.
\medskip
\item $400\termify{\prepostsub{1}{V}{x:\halfbox{2}}} = 16.58$
\medskip
\item The contract premium equals the benefit premium.
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip

Calculate the variance of the loss at issue.

The loss at issue is the benefit present value random variable minus 
the premium stream present value random variable. 

 The reserve $\prepostsub{t}{V}{}$ is the present value $t$ years after 
issue of the benefit to be paid, minus the present value of the premiums 
yet to be collected. Since at $t=1$ there is only one more year to 
go in the contract, and since premia are colllected at the beginning 
of the year, the present value of the remaining premiums to be collected
is exactly one annual premium, that is the amount given in 1. We have
\[
 16.58 = 400\termify{\prepostsub{1}{V}{x:\halfbox{2}}} 
 = 400 vq_{x+1} - 400\termify{P_{x:\halfbox{2}}} 
 = 400q_{x+1}/1.1 - 74.33.
\]
Solving for $q_{x+1}$ we have
\[
  q_{x+1} = {(16.58 + 74.33)1.1\over 400} = 0.2500025
\]
