A continuous two-life annuity pays:
\begin{description}
  \bull 100 while both (30) and (40) are alive;
  \bull 70 while (30) is alive but (40) is dead; and
  \bull 50 while (40) is alive but (30) is dead.
\end{description}
The actuarial present value of this annuity is 1180. Continuous single life annuities
paying 100 per year are available for (30) and (40) with actuarial present values of 1200
and 1000, respectively.

Calculate the actuarial present value of a two-life continuous annuity that pays 100 while
at least one of them is alive.
