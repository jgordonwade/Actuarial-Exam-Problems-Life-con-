\JGWitem{Nov 2006, \#25}
 You are given:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The future lifetimes of (40) and (50) are independent.
\item The survival function for (40) is based on a constant force of mortality, $\mu= 0.05.$
\item The survival function for (50) follows DeMoivre,s law with $\omega =110.$
\end{enumerate}
Calculate the probability that (50) dies within 10 years and dies before (40).
\showsol{\bsoln
With (x) being (50) and (y) being (40), they're asking for $\termify{\prepostsub{n}{q}{x:\!y}}$, for which we have:
\[
    \termify{\prepostsub{n}{q}{x:\!y}} = \int_{t=0}^n \prepostsub{t}{p}{xy}\,f_{T_x}(t)\,dt.
\]
From the given data, we have:
\bears
    \prepostsub{t}{p}{40} &=& e^{-0.05t} \\
    \prepostsub{t}{p}{50} &=& \frac{60-t}{60} \\
    \mu_{50}(t) &=& \frac{1}{60-t}.
\eears
So, 
\[
    \termify{\prepostsub{n}{q}{x:\!y}} = \int_{t=0}^{10} \dfrac{e^{-0.05t}}{60}\,dt = 0.13115.
\]
