A 5-year sickness insurance policy is based on a Markov model
\begin{center}{\em (diagram  showing the usual ``healthy-sick-dead'' model)} \\ with:
  \begin{tabular}{c|ccc} State number & 0 & 1 & 2 \\ \hline Meaning & Healthy & Sick & Dead \end{tabular}
\end{center}
You are given the following constant forces of transition:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\mu^{01} = 0.05$
\item $\mu^{10} = 0.02$
\item $\mu^{02} = 0.01$
\item $\mu^{12} = 0.06$
\end{enumerate}
Calculate the probability that a Healthy life will become Sick exactly once during the 5 years and remain continuously Sick from that point until the end of the 5 years.
\showsol{\bsoln
Use equation [DHW(2nd ed), equation (8.11), p. 252)]
which for this problem reads as
\[
    \prepostsubsup{5}{p}{x}{01} = \int_0^5 e^{-6t/100}\cdot\frac{5}{100}\cdot e^{-8(5-t)/100}\,dt  = 0.1762454
\]
In the usual ``healthy-sick-dead'' model, transitions from state 1 to state 0 are possible.
However, in this problem they are not: the problem asks for {\it ``the probability that a Healthy life will become Sick exactly once during the 5 years and remain continuously Sick \ldots.''}

Equation (8.11) pertains to the ``permanent disability'' model, in which state 0 can never be re-entered after it's been left, so it's appropriate.

To really understand this solution we have to really understand the derivation of (8.11).
