You are the producer for the television show Actuarial Idol. Each year, 1000 actuarial clubs audition for the show. The probability of a club being accepted is 0.20. 

\smallskip
The number of members of an accepted club has a distribution with mean 20 and variance 20. Club acceptances and the numbers of club members are mutually independent. 

\smallskip
Your annual budget for appearing on the show equals 10 times the expected number of persons plus 10 times the standard deviation of the number of persons. 

\smallskip
Calculate your annual budget for persons appearing on the show.

The number $S$ of people appearing on the show is a compound random variable where $N$ is the number of clubs accepted and $X$ is the number of members in an accepted club.
\bears
   N &\sim& \mbox{Binomial}(1000,0.2) \\
   \Expect{N} &=& 1000\times 0.2 = 200 \\
   \Var{N} &=& 1000\times 0.2 \times (1-0.2) = 160 \\
   \Expect{S} &=& \Expect{N}\Expect{X} = 200\times 20 = 4000 \\
   \Var{S} &=& \Var{N}\Expect{X}^2 + \Var{X}\Expect{N} \\
           &=& 160\times 20^2 + 20^2\times 200 = 68,000 = (260.768)^2 \\
   \mbox{Budget} &=& 10\times 4000 + 10\times 260.77 = 42,607.68
