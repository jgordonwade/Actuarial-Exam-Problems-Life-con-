 For a collective risk model the number of losses has a Poisson distribution 
with $\lambda = 20$. The common distribution of the individual losses has 
the following characteristics:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\Expect{X}=70$.
\item $\Expect{X\wedge 30}=25$.
\item $\Prob{X>30}=0.75$
\item $\Expect{X^2|X>30}=9000$.
\end{enumerate}
An insurance covers aggregate losses subject to an ordinary deductible of 
30 per loss.

Calculate the variance of the aggregate payments of the insurance.
