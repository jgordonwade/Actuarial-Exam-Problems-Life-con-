\JGWitem{C3 May 2014, \#6}
For a group of 100 lives age x with independent future lifetimes, you are given:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Each life is to be paid 1 at the beginning of each year, if alive.
  \item $A_x=0.45$
  \item $\pretwo{A}_x = 0.22$
  \item $i=0.05$
\end{enumerate}
Y is the present value random variable of the aggregate payments.

Using the normal approximation to Y, calculate the initial size of the fund needed in order to be 
95\% certain of being able to make the payments for these life annuities.

\showsol{\bsoln
Denoting by $Y_i$ the amount to one of the (x)'s, we have
\({\displaystyle
   Y = \sum_{i=1}^{100} Y_i,
}\)
and the $Y_i$'s are independent and identically distributed.

\medskip
Call the amount in the fund (which we seek) $F$, which is the 95$^{th}$ percentile of $Y$ if we model $Y$ as a normal R.V. This means that
\be
     F = \Expect{Y}+1.644\cdot \Std{Y}  \label{C3May2014_06_1}
\ee
so we need the mean and standard deviation of $Y$.

    \Expect{Y} &=& \sum_{i=1}^n\Expect{Y_i} = 100\ddot{a}_x = 100\cdot\left(\dfrac{1-A_x}{d}\right) = \dfrac{100(1-0.45)}{0.05/1.05} = 1155 \\
    \Var{Y} &=& \sum_{i=1}^n \Var{Y_i} = 100\cdot\left(\dfrac{\pretwo{A}_x-A^2_x}{d^2}\right) \\
    \Std{Y} &=& \sqrt{\Var{Y}} = \dfrac{10}{d}\sqrt{\pretwo{A}_x-A^2_x} = \dfrac{10}{0.05/1.05} \sqrt{0.22-0.45^2} = 27.78039

\[
     F = 1155+1.644\cdot 27.78039 = \boxed{1200.695}
\]

Here's a review of where equation (\ref{C3May2014_06_1}) comes from. We want the amount $F$ for which $\boxed{\Prob{Y\leq F}=0.95}$, which is the same as
\[
    \Prob{\dfrac{Y-\Expect{Y}}{\Std{Y}}\leq \dfrac{F-\Expect{Y}}{\Std{Y}} } = 0.95.
\]
If $Y$ is normal (which is approximately true since $Y$ is the sum of 100 iid R.V.'s), then this is the same as 
\bears
    \Prob{Z \leq \dfrac{F-\Expect{Y}}{\Std{Y}} } &=& 0.95, \quad\text{ where } Z\sim \text{Normal}(0,1)  \\
    \dfrac{F-\Expect{Y}}{\Std{Y}}  &=& \Phi^{-1}(0.95) \approx 1.644
\eears
which leads to (\ref{C3May2014_06_1}).
