A 3-year term insurance pays 1000 at the end of the year of death of (x) if
that death occurs within three years, and level premium are payable annually.
You are given:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $i= 0.10$
\item The mortality rates and net premium policy values are given by: 
\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
   $k$ & $q_{x+k}$ & $\prepostsub{k+1}{V}{}$ \\ \hline
    0 & 0.3 &	95.833  \\ \hline
    1 &	0.4 &	120.833 \\ \hline
    2 &	0.5 &  0 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}\end{center}
\item $\prepostsub{1}{L}{}$ is the present value net loss random variable at time 1, based on the benefit premium. 
\item $K_x$ is the full number of years in the future lifetime of (x).
\end{enumerate}
Calculate $\Var{\prepostsub{1}{L}{}\left|\right.\,K_x\geq 1}$.

After one year, given that $K_x\geq 1$, the remaining contract is a two-year term insurance, and
Since the policy is a three year term insurance, then the benefit reserve after two years is
\(
   \prepostsub{2}{V}{}= 1000v q_{x+2} - P
\)
from which we can find $P$:
\bears
   _2\!V &=& 1000v q_{x+2} - P 
    \\ P &=& 1000v q_{x+2} - _2\!V = \dfrac{1000}{1.1}0.5 - 120.833 = 333.71.

Now, one year into this 3-year term insurance, there are three possibilities given that the insured has survived the first year
(e.g, that $K_x\geq 1$) : The insured could die between $t=1$ and $t=2$, which is when $K_x=1$, or 
the insured could die between $t=2$ and $t=3$, which is when $K_x=2$, or the insured could survive the term if the insurance,
which is $K_x\geq 3$. We have
\bears
   \Prob{K_x=1}=q_{x+1}=0.4 \\
   \Prob{K_x=2}=\qx{1|}{x+1}=(1-\qx{x+1})\qx{x+2}=(1-0.4)\cdot0.5=0.3, \\
   \Prob{K_x\geq 3}=\px[2]{x+1} = 1-(0.3-0.4) = 0.3.

So:
\bears
   \prepostsub{1}{L}{} &=& \left\{\begin{array}{cl} 
      1000v-P & \mbox{ w/ prob. } 0.4, \\
      1000v^2-P(1+v) & \mbox{ w/ prob. } 0.3, \\
      -P(1+v) & \mbox{ w/ prob. } 0.3 \\
    \end{array}\right\}
   = \left\{\begin{array}{rl} 
           575.38 & \mbox{ w/ prob. } 0.4, \\
          189.36 & \mbox{ w/ prob. } 0.3, \\
          -637.08 & \mbox{ w/ prob. } 0.3 \\
    \end{array}\right. \\
%\eears
%\bears    
    \Expect{_1\!V} &=&   575.38\cdot 0.4 + 189.36 \cdot 0.3 + (-637.08)\cdot  0.3 = 95.836, \\
    \Expect{\left(_1\!V\right)^2} &=&   (575.38)^2\cdot 0.4 + (189.36)^2 \cdot 0.3 + (-637.08)^2\cdot  0.3 = 264,943, \\
    \Var{_1\!V} &=& 264,943 - 95.836^2 = \boxed{255,758}
