\JGWitem{Nov 2000, \#34}  % Markov chain
The Town Council purchases weather insurance for their annual July 14 picnic.
\begin{enumerate}
\item For each of the next three years, the insurance pays 1000 on July 4 if it rains on that day.
\item Weather is modeled by a Markov chain, with two states, as follows:
   \begin{enumerate}
        \item The probability that it rains on a day is 0.50 if it rained on the prior day.
        \item The probability that it rains on a day is 0.20 if it did not rain on the prior day.
    \end{enumerate}
\item $ i = 0.10$
\end{enumerate}
Calculate the single benefit premium for this insurance purchased one year before the
first scheduled picnic.

\showsol{\bsoln
   Chance of rain on a random day in the distant future, $p$, $p=2/7$.

   Premium $=\dfrac{2}{7}\cdot 1000\cdot\left(\dfrac{1}{1.1} + \dfrac{1}{1.1^2} +\dfrac{1}{1.13} \right)$

   Premium $=\boxed{710.53}$
