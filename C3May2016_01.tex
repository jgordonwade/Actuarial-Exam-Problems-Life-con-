\JGWitem{ Spring 2016, \#1} % Markov discrete time
You are using a Markov model for the future repair status of televisions. The three states are:
\begin{description}
 \item Fully Functional (F),
 \item Requires Repairs (R), and
 \item Beyond Repair (B).
\end{description}
You are given:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The following annual probability transition matrix:
  $\left[\begin{array}{ccc} 0.82 & 0.10 & 0.08 \\ 0.60 & 0.05 & 0.35 \\ 0.00 & 0.00 & 1.00 \end{array}\right]$
\item There are now five televisions that are Fully Functional.
\item The status of each television is independent of the status of the others.
\end{enumerate}
Calculate the probability that exactly two of these five televisions will be Fully
Functional at the end of two years.

\showsol{\bsoln
 The number of TV's functional after two years follows a Binomial(5,p) distribution where $p$ is given by the top left entry of the 1-year transition matrix squared.

 That entry is: $0.82^2 + 0.10\cdot 0.6 + 0.08\cdot 0 = 0.7324$ so this is the value of $p$.

  \[ \Prob{N=2}=0.102791. \]
