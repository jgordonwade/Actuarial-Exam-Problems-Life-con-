 Insurance losses are a compound Poisson process where:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The approvals of insurance applications arise in accordance with a Poisson process at
a rate of 1000 per day.
\item Each approved application has a 20\% chance of being from a smoker and an 80\%
 chance of being from a non-smoker.
\item The insurances are priced so that the expected loss on each approval is $-100$.
\item The variance of the loss amount is 5000 for a smoker and is 8000 for a non-smoker.
\end{enumerate}
Calculate the variance for the total losses on one day's approvals.

Assuming that the losses from each application are independent, we can decompose the total loss $S$ into the losses $S_1$ due to smokers
and the losses $S_2$ due to non-smokers, and $\Var{S}=\Var{S_1} + \Var{S_2}$. Each of $S_1$ and $S_2$ are compound random variables with Poisson frequency. We have:
\bears
   \Var{S_1} &=& \Var{N_1}\Expect{X_1}^2 + \Expect{N_1}\Var{X_1} \\
              &=& 200\times 100^2 + 200\times 5000 = 3,000,000 \\
   \Var{S_2} &=& \Var{N_2}\Expect{X_2}^2 + \Expect{N_2}\Var{X_2} \\
              &=& 800\times 100^2 + 800\times 8000 = 14,400,000 \\
   \Var{S} &=& 3,000,000 + 14,400,000 = 17,400,000
