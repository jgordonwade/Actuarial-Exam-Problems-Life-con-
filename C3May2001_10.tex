For students entering a college, you are given the following from a multiple decrement
model:
\begin{enumerate}
\item 1000 students enter the college at $t = 0 .$
\item Students leave the college for failure (1) or all other reasons (2).
\item $\mu^{(1)}(t) = \mu$ and $\mu^{(2)}(t) = 0.04$, both for $t\in[0,4]$.
\item 48 students are expected to leave the college during their first year due to all causes.
\end{enumerate}
Calculate the expected number of students who will leave because of failure during their
fourth year.

We want $l_3q_3^{(1)}$. 

First, let's get $\mu^{(\tau)}$. Since $\mu^{(\tau)} = \mu^{(1)} = \mu^{(2)}$
and (from given (d)) $(1000-48) = l_0\,q_0^{(\tau)} = 1000e^{-\mu^{(\tau)}}$, we find 
$\mu^{(\tau)} = 0.04919$ so that $\mu^{(1)}=0.00919$. 

Now,
\bears
   l_3q_3^{(1)} &=& 1000\cdot \prepostsubsup{3}{p}{0}{(\tau)}\cdot q_3^{(1)} \\
               &=& 1000\cdot \,e^{-3\mu^{(\tau)}}\, \int_0^1 \mu^{(1)}e^{-t\mu^{(\tau)}}\,dt \\
               &=& 1000\cdot e^{-3\times 0.04919} \left(\frac{0.00919}{0.04919}\right)\left(1-e^{-0.04919}\right) = \underline{7.7373}
