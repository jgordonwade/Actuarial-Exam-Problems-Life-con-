A company provides insurance to a concert hall for losses due to power 
failure. You are given:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The number of power failures in a year has a Poisson distribution 
 with mean 1.
\item The distribution of ground up losses due to a single power failure is:
\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{c|c}
  $x$ & $\Prob{\mbox{loss}=x}$ \\ \hline
   10 & 0.3 \\
   20 & 0.3 \\
   50 & 0.4
\end{tabular}\end{center}
\item The number of power failures and the amounts of losses are independent.
\item There is an annual deductible of 30.
\end{enumerate}

Calculate the expected amount of claims paid by the insurer in one year.
