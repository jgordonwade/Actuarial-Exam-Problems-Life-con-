\JGWitem{May 2013, \#4}  
Employment for Joe is modeled according to a two-state homogeneous Markov modeled with states:
\begin{quote}\begin{description} \item Actuary (Ac) \item Professional Hockey Player (H) \end{description}\end{quote}
You are given:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] Transitions occur December 31 of each year. The one-year transition probabilities are:
   \[ \begin{array}{c} \text{Ac} \\ \text{H} \end{array}        \left[\begin{array}{cc} 0.4 & 06 \\ 0.8 & 0.2 \end{array}\right] \]
\item[(ii)] Mortality for Joe depends on his employment:
\bears
    \qx{35+k}[Ac] &=& 0.10 + 0.05k \qquad\text{for }k=0,1,2, \\
    \qx{35+k}[H] &=& 0.25 + 0.05k \qquad\text{for }k=0,1,2.
\eears
\item[(iii)] $i = 0.08$
\end{itemize}
On January 1, 2013, Joe turned 35 years old and was employed as an actuary. On that
date, he purchased a 3-year pure endowment of 100,000.
Calculate the expected present value at issue of the pure endowment.
\showsol{\bsoln
There are four possible career paths for Joe, shown
\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{ccl|c} Path & ${\rm Prob}\{\text{Path}\}$ & \rule{10pt}{0pt} ${\rm Prob}\{\text{Survival}|\text{Path}\}$ & product \\ \hline
   $A\rightarrow A\rightarrow A$ & $0.4\times 0.4$ & $0.9\cdot(0.9-0.05)\cdot(0.9-0.1)$ &  0.09792 \\
   $A\rightarrow A\rightarrow H$ & $0.4\times 0.6$ & $0.9\cdot(0.9-0.05)\cdot(0.75-0.1) $ & 0.11934 \\
   $A\rightarrow H\rightarrow A$ & $0.6\times 0.8$ & $0.9\cdot(0.75-0.05)\cdot(0.9-0.1) $ & 0.24192 \\
   $A\rightarrow H\rightarrow H$ & $0.6\times 0.2$ & $0.9\cdot(0.75-0.05)\cdot(0.75-0.1) $ & 0.04914
\end{tabular}\end{center}
So Joe's probality of surviving three years is $0.09792 +   0.11934 +   0.24192 +   0.04914 = 0.50832$, 
so the EPV of the endowment is $100,000\cdot 0.50832\cdot 1.08^{-3} = \boxed{40352.08}$
