Mr. Ucci has only 3 hairs left on his head and he won't be growing any more.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The future mortality of each hair follows
  $\prepostsub{k}{q}{x} = 0.1(k +1)$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, 3,$, and x is Mr. Ucci's age
\item Hair loss follows the hyperbolic assumption at fractional ages.
\item The future lifetimes of the 3 hairs are independent.
\end{enumerate}
Calculate the probability that 
Mr. Ucci is bald (has no hair left) at age $x + 2.5 .$
