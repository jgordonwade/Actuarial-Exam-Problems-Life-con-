\JGWitem{C3 Nov 2013 \#04} % LTAM Sample Q's (Nov 2019) #8.8
In a homogeneous Markov model with three states: Healthy (H), Sick (S), and Dead (D), you are given:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] The monthly transition probabilities are:
\[ \begin{array}{c} \text{H} \\ \text{S} \\ \text{D} \end{array}  \left[ \begin{array}{ccc} 0.75 & 0.20 & 0.05 \\ 0.30 & 0.50 & 0.20 \\ 0.00 & 0.00 & 1.00 \end{array}\right]. \]
\item[(ii)]
\end{itemize}
 Initially there are 10 Healthy lives with independent future states.

 Calculate the probability that exactly 4 lives will die during the first two months.

\showsol{\bsoln
  If we call the transition matrix $Q$ then the $\{1,3\}$ entry of $Q^2$ gives us the probability an H transitions to D within two months.
  This value is $0.1275$.

  \bigskip
  Out of 10 individuals, each of whom as a $0.1275$ probability of dying, the number $N$  
   of people who dies follows a Binomial(10,0.1275) disrtibition, and 
   \bears
       \Prob{N=4} &=& {10 \choose 4} 0.1275^4 \cdot (1-0.1275)^6  = \boxed{0.02448}
