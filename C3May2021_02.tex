In the first year of operations, each machine in a factory is subjected to a constant force
of failure, $\mu.$ The probability that any given machine fails within the year is 0.1.

In the second year, the force of failure will increase linearly over the year from $\mu$ to $2\mu.$
In the third year, the force of failure will be constant at $2\mu.$

At the start of the first year the factory has 20,000 machines, all new. Calculate the
expected number of machines still functioning at the end of year 3.
