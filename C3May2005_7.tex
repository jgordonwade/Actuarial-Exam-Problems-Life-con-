 $Z$ is the present-value random variable for a whole life insurance of $b$ 
payable at the moment of death of (x).

\medskip
You are given:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\delta = 0.04$
\item $\mu_x(t)=0.02$ for $t\geq 0$.
\item The single benefit premium for this insurance is equal to $\Var{Z}$.
\end{enumerate}
Calculate $b$.

The random variable $Z$ is equal to $bZ_x$, and the single benefit premium is $\Expect{Z}$. We need to equate $\Expect{Z}$ with $\Var{Z}$ and solve for $b$.
\bears
   \Expect{Z} &=& \Var{Z} \\ 
   bA_x &=& b^2\left(\pretwo{A}_x - A_x^2\right) \\
   b &=& \frac{A_x}{\pretwo{A}_x - A_x^2}
\eears
Since the force of interest and force of mortality are both constant, we have
\bears
   A_x &=& \frac{\mu}{\mu+\delta} = \frac{1}{3} \\
   \pretwo{A}_x &=& \frac{\mu}{\mu+2\delta} = \frac{1}{5}, 
\eears
so that 
\[
  b = \frac{1/3}{1/5 - 1/9} = 15/4= \underline{3.75}
\]
