 The scores on the final exam in Ms. B's Latin class have a normal 
distribution with mean $\theta$
and standard deviation equal to 8. $\theta$ a random variable with a normal 
distribution with mean equal to 75 and standard deviation equal to 6.

Each year, Ms. B chooses a student at random and pays the student 1 times 
the student's score. However, if the student udent fails the exam 
(score $\leq$ 65 ), then there is no payment.

Calculate the conditional probability that the payment is less than 90, 
given that there is a payment.

Let $X$ be the exam score. We have 
\bears
  \Expect{X} &=& \Expect{\Expect{X|\Theta}} = \Expect{\Theta} = 75, \\
  \Var{X} &=& \Var{\Expect{X|\Theta}} + \Expect{\Var{X|\Theta}} = \Var{\Theta} + \Expect{8^2} = 6^2 + 8^2 = 10^2.

  \Prob{X\leq 90|X>65} &=& \frac{\Prob{65<X \mbox{ and }X\leq 90}}{\Prob{65<X}} \\
    &=& \frac{\Prob{(65-75)/10<Z \mbox{ and }Z\leq (90-75)/10}}{\Prob{(65-75)/10<Z}} \\
    &=& \frac{\Phi(1.5)-\Phi(-1.0)}{1-\Phi(-1.0)} \\
    &=& \frac{\Phi(1.5)-1+\Phi(1.0)}{\Phi(1.0)} = \frac{  0.93319 - 1 + 0.84134}{0.84134}  = 0.9206
