A fully discrete 3-year term insurance of 10,000 on (40) is based on a 
double-decrement model, death and withdrawal:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Decrement 1 is death.
\item $\mu^{(1)}_{40}=0.02$.
\item Decrement 2 is withdrawal, which occurs at the end of the year.
\item $q_{40+k}^{'(2)}=0.04$
\item $v = 0.95$
\end{enumerate}
Calculate the actuarial present value of the death benefits for this insurance.
